# Pacman iEEG Task

iWe will test
subjects (n=7-10) on a novel continuous-
choice approach-avoidance conflict task
based on the arcade game Pacman. The game
was simplified to be played along a single
corridor. The decision to move towards the
center of the corridor is thus associated with
both potential gains (eating “dots”, resulting
in points) and potential losses (ghost attack,
resulting in loss of a life). Participants may
collect as much reward as they choose, before
turning around and exiting the trial by leaving
through the end of the corridor. Importantly,
both being chased and being caught by the
ghost are determined by the player&#39;s distance
to the ghost. The closer the participant
chooses to go to the ghost, the higher the
likelihood that the ghost will both 1) initiate a
chase and 2) be fast enough to catch Pacman.
The game is played as a series of mini-
blocks, which end when either 1) Pacman loses all three lives or 2) twenty trials are completed. We will collect
a total of 10 mini-blocks, corresponding to 200 trials.
